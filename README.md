All the assignments of Java Training
Day 1 – Hello world. Just to verify that Java has been setup well and we are off and running-Hello.java

Day 2 – Build a simple calculator that takes 2 numbers as input and calculated the sum of 2 numbers-Calculator.java

Day 4 – I have a string "I am learning Java". Reverse the string without using any system provided functions-StrReverse.java

Day 5 – Create a simple quiz. User is asked 10 questions with choices given and he answers by inputting the choices via console. Once answered, user should be moved to next question. At the end show the user how much did he score out of 10. User inputs should be validated. Any invalid input should lead to user being prompted to enter the valid answer choice again for the same question.
Add an extra check that program terminates and lets the user know he failed when he gets 4 answers wrong. For example, if an user gets 4 out of first 6 itself wrong then do not show the remaining questions and exit out telling the user that he failed.
Questions and answers can be hard-coded. It would be a great addition if you can keep a bank of 20-25 questions and show 10 randomly to the user.
