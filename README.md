# JavaTraining
All the assignments of Java Training
Week 1
Day 1 – Hello world. Just to verify that Java has been setup well and we are off and running-1Hello

Day 2 – Build a simple calculator that takes 2 numbers as input and calculated the sum of 2 numbers-2Calculator

Day 4 – I have a string "I am learning Java". Reverse the string without using any system provided functions-3StrReverse

Day 5 – Create a simple quiz. User is asked 10 questions with choices given and he answers by inputting the choices via console. Once answered, user should be moved to next question. At the end show the user how much did he score out of 10. User inputs should be validated. Any invalid input should lead to user being prompted to enter the valid answer choice again for the same question.
Add an extra check that program terminates and lets the user know he failed when he gets 4 answers wrong. For example, if an user gets 4 out of first 6 itself wrong then do not show the remaining questions and exit out telling the user that he failed.
Questions and answers can be hard-coded. It would be a great addition if you can keep a bank of 20-25 questions and show 10 randomly to the user.

Week 2
There is an online Exercise system
- It has 3 types of exercises
- Walking, Cycling, Running
System should be flexible to enhance to accommodate any type of exercise in the
future.Given an exercise for a user, System should print the calories burned for that
exercise.
For e.g.
Input :
User - Philip
Exercise Type - Walking
Duration - 30 min
Date : (If not provided, default to current date else date in mm-dd-yyyy format)
Output :
n calories
Use any formula to calculate the calories.
System also should support aggregated mode as well as detailed mode.
For e.g. If there are multiple exercises for the same user on same day, system should
print the sum of calories burned in aggregated mode. In detail mode, it should print all
the exercise details.By default it should print exercise details in Aggregate mode and the order should be
sorted by User, Date, Exercise Type.
